This is a personal project to help me manage my openrct2 server.

This is version 1.0, bugs may exist

To use:

Place the .bat in the same folder as  openrct2.exe 

In order for BLS_OpenRCT2 to function properly you must define your openrct2.exe, saves, and autosaves locations at the top of the .bat

You can also add server arguments if so desired.
